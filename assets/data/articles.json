Sociable baboons yawn, but so do semi-solitary orangutans. Parakeets, penguins and crocodiles yawn \u2013 and so, probably, did the first ever jawed fish. Until relatively recently, the purpose of yawning wasn\u2019t clear, and it\u2019s still contested by researchers and scientists.

Of course, some of light\u2019s effects on our bodies are well established. Sunlight helps us make vitamin D, needed for bone health, immunity, muscles and more. Sunlight regulates our circadian rhythms, too, triggering the release of neurochemicals and hormones while we are awake, and winding down bodily functions for sleep as it fades into night. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/29/best-sunrise-alarm-clocks\">Sunlight-imitating lamps</a> are a common remedy for people with seasonal affective disorder (Sad) to boost low mood in winter.

He took them camping and on cycling trips, and he raved about them to friends. Slowly, they became a pantry staple for us. When I have the time, I like to batch-cook my own curry sauce and freeze it, but when there isn\u2019t time, we love this meal. It feels embarrassingly easy to make, because the cubes bring all the flavour, and also quite fancy at the same time thanks to the egg yolk.

Like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/sep/03/simon-amstell-review-shame-self-analysis-and-great-gags\">any Amstell set</a>, I Love It Here is self-analytical to an absurd degree \u2013 and this level of forensic solipsism, from this clever and funny a man, can\u2019t help but be engaging. But departure it is not \u2013 and indeed, I found it frustrating how Amstell\u2019s concerns have not moved on a jot in a show largely about his disappointment (\u201cpain\u201d, he would call it) that his crush on a famous singer isn\u2019t reciprocated.</p><p>The abiding impression, of a show set at a star-studded Hollywood party, is of an artist whose life (and creative output) might benefit from a little more friction. We encounter Amstell at the start of this set blissful with his partner of 14 years, increasingly at ease with himself after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/07/simon-amstell-i-used-to-think-i-couldnt-talk-about-enjoying-sex\">overcoming shame</a>. But an invitation to a Tinseltown bash, where his erstwhile teenage crush will be in attendance, brings out Simon\u2019s wounded inner child. And so we\u2019re pitched into a long anecdote in which fretful Amstell butterflies around with Baz Luhrmann, Viola Davis and Charli xcx, seeking to absolve his childhood agonies by coupling up with an unnamed pop hunk.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/oct/26/simon-amstell-review-i-love-it-here-arches-london-bridge\">Continue reading...</a>",

At age 13, Noori\u2019s mother, Hawa, was married off to a man 30 years her senior. Now with grownup children, she can finally embark on her own mission: to learn how to read and write, and to open her own textile business. Even though supported by her family, Hawa\u2019s hopes and dreams are suffused with melancholy; soon, even more draconian laws will be imposed on Afghan women.</p><p>During the calm before the storm, Noori\u2019s roving camera serves as a facilitator for intergenerational dialogue. With stunning candour, Hawa speaks of her unhappy married life, and her past desire to elope with another man. In a painful twist of fate, the cycle continues with Zahra, Hawa\u2019s granddaughter and Noori\u2019s niece. Looking for refuge at the Noori household after running away from her father\u2019s village, her aspiration is to return to her studies. A particularly tender sequence shows Zahra and Hawa sharing the same whiteboard as they practise their spelling. Their happiness is sadly short-lived; with the Taliban closing in, Zahra is sent back to her father\u2019s family for protection. In the end, she is forced into marriage, not unlike Hawa in her youth.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/oct/27/writing-hawa-review-afghan-woman-liberation-taliban-documentary\">Continue reading...</a>",

      "summary": "<p>A biscuit crossed with a flapjack crossed with a bread pudding: these snacks are best enjoyed with a hot drink</p><p>This, then, was the situation: it was Friday night after a long week, and having met a friend on the way home for a glass of wine, which arrived with crisps, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/oct/25/rachel-roddy-recipe-lemon-knot-biscuits-taralli-snacks\">taralli</a></em>, dry roasted peanuts and enough salt that we needed another glass, it seemed a good idea to go home and cook polenta \u2013 the long-stir sort as opposed to the instant variety, although I always have that in the cupboard, too. Another good idea, which came to me as I pulled a new packet from the back of the dresser and ignored the flutter of tiny wings, was to make more than enough polenta and pour the extra into a Pyrex dish while it was still hot, so it could set into a block to be cut into slices and grilled the next day.</p><p>I\u2019ve written about polenta before; how the word is ancient and generic \u2013 referring to any mushy dish made from cereal flour and water \u2013 and how, after its arrival in Europe in the 1600s, it became synonymous with ground maize. There exists a world of different grades and milling, but, broadly speaking, when you buy ground maize (cornmeal) for polenta, you will have two options: finely ground (which might also be white) for a soft, thin polenta, and coarsely ground, which will have glassy-looking grains and makes an excellent body scrub and a harder, tastier polenta. The latter also takes much longer to cook, anything from 40 minutes to several hours, depending on who (or which packet) you consult, although in my experience an hour is almost always enough, and anything beyond that is more a way of deepening the flavour. Stirring is also a matter of opinion, with some saying it must be constant, while others (hello, Anna Del Conte!) noting that after 10 minutes, if the heat is low enough, you can in fact leave the pan to attend to other things, coming back every now and then to give it a strong, hard stir.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/oct/23/leftover-polenta-biscuits-recipe-rachel-roddy\">Continue reading...</a>",

Aside from the logistics of designing a house that functions successfully in such an unforgiving setting, planning permission is likely to make it a nonstarter. But on the shore of Loch Long on the Rosneath peninsula, 40 miles north-west of Glasgow, John MacKinnon and his wife Laura found a way to make it work for their house, Rock Cove. While the area is wild and ruggedly beautiful, its history has long been intertwined with the military and was once a brownfield site, home to&nbsp;disused Ministry of Defence huts and garages, overgrown and strewn with rubble.</p><p>Back in 2008, MacKinnon had bought a property on the same site, a 1940s cottage that had been repurposed as a navy signalling station. MacKinnon has a deep-seated passion for design, and worked closely with architect Stuart Cameron of Cameron Webster to completely reimagine this humble property as a modernist beach house, Cape Cove. He&nbsp;then began contemplating what could be done with the scruffy space alongside his new home.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/oct/24/modernist-beach-house-rock-cove-loch-long-scotland\">Continue reading...</a>",

An unseen force \u201cis destroying the air and the seasons\u201d; at the same time, \u201cmoney\u2019s going bad, and no one knows why\u201d.

This is, by all accounts, Pullman\u2019s concluding foray into the intricately constructed, infinitely beguiling realm he first unveiled 30 years ago, with the publication of Northern Lights. It\u2019s a realm whose geography maps on to that of this world, but whose history tacks and jibes with ours; where the humans look and think and act like us, but are accompanied by daemons, souls in animal form; where the skies are filled with witches and gryphons, but beneath those skies, buses are caught and tea is drunk, and middle-aged academics carry Harrods shopping bags. Lyra, whom we first met as a 12-year-old in the His Dark Materials trilogy, and then saw again as a baby in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/18/the-book-of-dust-vol-1-la-belle-sauvage-by-philip-pullman-review\">La Belle Sauvage</a>, the prequel with which Pullman began The Book of Dust, is now a young woman: still recognisably the spiky and tenacious heroine of the earlier books, but older, sadder, more cautious, less certain. This circumscription is amplified by her separation from her daemon, Pantalaimon \u2013 but it was also, ironically, the trigger which caused him to abandon her in the first place.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/oct/23/the-rose-field-by-philip-pullman-nail-biting-conclusion-to-the-northern-lights-series\">Continue reading...</a>",

The latter were caused by the duo\u2019s frontman, Marc Almond, clad in eyeliner and jewellery, delivering his vocal with a weird combination of intense passion, high camp and occasional knowing looks to camera: he was clearly a gay man, but a gay man who declined to conform to the pantomime stereotype that still prevailed on British TV, a decision that first upset his own record company boss \u2013 who collared Almond backstage and protested \u201cyou\u2019ve got to butch it up a bit!\u201d \u2013 then apparently caused the BBC\u2019s switchboards to light up.</p><p>Almond was such an arresting presence that it was easy to overlook the other guy on stage, moustachioed, mute and virtually motionless behind his keyboard.

This week, the Guardian revealed that one of the first people deported under the treaty had found his way <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/22/man-sent-to-france-under-one-in-one-out-scheme-returns-to-uk-on-small-boat\">back to the UK</a> via a small boat. On the same day, Home Office data revealed that the number of people who had made the journey so far this year \u2013 36,886 \u2013 had surpassed the total for 2024. The usual partisan recriminations followed. Opposition parties accuse Labour of failing to grip the problem; ministers say they are burdened by a long legacy of Conservative mismanagement. Both things can be true.</p><p>For all its deficiencies, Sir Keir\u2019s deal with France recognises two facts that his Tory and Reform UK opponents cannot accept. First, engagement with EU&nbsp;states is a sine qua non of functional migration policy. Second, without some legal mechanism for accepting refugees, desperate people will always gamble on the illegal ways.</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In the year since his election, the president\u2019s rage and whims have assumed the form of policies in the same way that Joseph Stalin\u2019s purges could be called policies. Figures within the federal system of justice who do not do his bidding are summarily <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/17/politics/lindsey-halligan-ousts-more-prosecutors-eastern-district-virginia\">fired and replaced</a> by loyalists. Leaders who have called him to account or are in his way may face indictment, trial and punishment. Opponents have been designated under <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/countering-domestic-terrorism-and-organized-political-violence/\">Presidential National Security Memorandum No 7</a> as \u201cAntifa\u201d: \u201canti-American\u201d, \u201canti-Christian\u201d and \u201canti-capitalist\u201d, and threatened with prosecution as a \u201cterrorist\u201d. Meanwhile, many aligned with him escape justice, whether through the hand of the Department of Justice (DoJ) or the presidential pardon power. Now, he demands <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/us/politics/trump-justice-department-compensation.html\">compensation</a> for having been prosecuted to the tune of $230m from the DoJ budget.</p><p>Each of the cases involving prosecution of Trump\u2019s enemies and, on the other hand, the leniency extended to his allies has its own peculiarities of outrage. But whatever their unique and arbitrary perversities, they are expressions of what has emerged as a technique. These episodes are not isolated or coincidental. Trump\u2019s purge of DoJ prosecutors and FBI agents, accompanied by his installment of flunkies in senior positions, started in a rush and quickly assumed a pattern, but has now been molded into a regime. The justice department and the FBI have been remade into political agencies under Trump\u2019s explicit command to carry out his wishes. Injustice is made routine. It is the retribution system.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/24/donald-trump-has-built-a-regime-of-retribution-and-reward\">Continue reading...</a>",

It may not surprise you to learn that her first show since is about actual parenthood, of a now 18-month-old boy, with help from her visiting Lebanese- and Irish-American parents. Childrearing may not take a village in This Is What You Waited For, but it takes an extended family \u2013 which prompts reflection from our host on how she was mothered, and what kind of mother she can be.</p><p>Not for the first time with Harouni, I found the smoothness and control of her hour on that theme almost too neat. A proponent of \u201cgentle parenting\u201d, she practises gentle and measured comedy too. The jokes are very deftly sprung as we\u2019re led through her experience of raising an uncommonly large baby boy, with detours via her relationships with her husband, dad and mom. One fine wisecrack skewers her sports-fan father\u2019s opposition to they/them pronouns. There\u2019s another on how unqualified new mothers are for childcare, and a choice gag about the similarities between the new arrival in her family and a colonialist Brit.</p><p>At <a href=\"https://sohotheatre.com/events/janine-harouni-this-is-what-you-waited-for/\">Soho theatre, London</a>, until 1 November. <a href=\"https://www.janineharouni.com/\">Then touring</a></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/oct/22/janine-harouni-this-is-what-you-waited-for-review-soho-theatre-london\">Continue reading...</a>",

It\u2019s not a making-of movie, although there are snippets of insight into the production\u2019s process; nor is it a meta-commentary at the same sprawling level of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/oct/25/room-237-review\">Room 237</a>, the delirious doc about The Shining. Instead, Chain Reaction is something in between, constructed in five chapters featuring interviews with five very different, almost random-seeming interlocutors who have strong feelings about The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. These are: comedian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/19/patton-oswalt-id-rather-be-doctor-who-than-james-bond-less-having-to-take-your-shirt-off\">Patton Oswalt</a>, film-makers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/takashi-miike\">Takashi Miike</a> (Audition, Ichi the Killer) and Karyn Kusama (Girlfight, Jennifer\u2019s Body), academic Alexandra Heller-Nicholas, and writer Stephen King.</p><p>One may wonder why these five people are featured and not, say, any other bunch of opinionated famous movie buffs, but at least they have pretty interesting things to say. Each quilts together their own personal experience of the film with more general musings on cinema, technique, horror vo terror, and that annoying conversation stopper at every dinner party: the zeitgeist. We learn, for instance, that Takashi first saw Texas Chain Saw when he was 15, and chose it only because he couldn\u2019t get in to see a rereleased print of City Lights by Charlie Chaplin. (He has still not seen the latter, he says.)</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/oct/22/chain-reactions-review-stephen-king-takashi-miike-patton-oswalt-texas-chain-saw-massacre\">Continue reading...</a>",

This is a natural process in many cacti, which causes the lower stem to gradually harden and turn brown, like the bark on a tree.

However, because corking can be confused with a fungal infection or pests such as scale insects, it\u2019s worth a closer look. Scale insects will appear as raised, uniform bumps that can be scraped off, whereas corking is part of the stem tissue itself and cannot be removed.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/oct/21/houseplant-clinic-what-are-the-brown-patches-on-my-prickly-pear\">Continue reading...</a>",

This thrilling show, boasting 270 works, reveals the German in all his contradictory brilliance</p><p>Gerhard Richter recalls, as a child, drawing with his finger on his empty, slightly greasy dinner plate, tracing and retracing fanciful curves and spatial structures in endless alterations on the china. Decades later, he would place blobs of different colours on a canvas then intermingle them using slithery curving brushstrokes, lubricated by the oil and paint, until the entire surface was covered. More or less pure colour slid among the passages of impure, much-mixed pigment. Other paintings were made using large squeegees and spatulas, pushing and dragging paint over the surface, and just as often scraping it off again. The squeegee would often pick up previously applied, sometimes half-dried paint, excavating previous layers even as it applied new ones. Smearing paint on, dragging it off again, Richter would keep working until he could no longer think of anything else to do to a painting. One day in 2017, he stopped painting entirely. Since then, he has devoted himself mostly to drawing.</p><p>Richter\u2019s art is filled with beginnings and endings, revelling in chance as often as he has used craftsmanship and exactitude to paint people and places and things, from flowers wilting in a vase to street corners, elegiac landscapes and the dead. Standing amid his retrospective at the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris, it strikes me that however one chooses to describe or compartmentalise the different strands of his work, his art remains irreducible. It\u2019s contrarian, fickle, controlled yet intemperate, the contradictions make a mockery of fixed readings.

Epstein hanged himself in prison while awaiting trial in 2019 and Ghislaine Maxwell, his co-conspirator, is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, outcomes largely enabled by Giuffre\u2019s testimony.

The story could have been lifted straight from a Hollywood movie or an episode of the French mystery thriller series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/oct/05/netflix-lupin-season-three-review-omar-sy-born-action-star-next-bond\">Lupin</a>.</p><p>Yet, although this outrageous theft has stunned France, it was perhaps a fitting act of larceny for a country that has just been the victim of another incredible heist. From one Monday to the next the French people were swindled into thinking we were getting a new government. The political drama left many of us feeling like confused characters in Groundhog Day, but perhaps the closer symbolism is to be found in the surreal theft at the Louvre.</p><p>Rokhaya Diallo is a Guardian Europe columnist</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Last week it emerged that plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) aren\u2019t very green. The sales pitch had been that motorists could use \u201cclean\u201d battery power for city jaunts and dirty petrol for longer trips. This promised sustainable travel without the anxiety of a limited range.

It is set in the futuristic World State, whose citizens are scientifically engineered to fit into a hierarchy. Eugenics, psychotropic pharmaceuticals and classical conditioning are employed to maximise stability and happiness. Huxley\u2019s novel does not describe a conventionally authoritarian system, but one in which the desire for freedom and dignity has simply been eliminated. The World State is a radical technocracy.<br /><br />\n It\u2019s a satire on the consequences of importing scientific thinking into the realm of social policy. The Controllers of the World State preside over a society that has rationality and efficiency as its guiding principles, and when those principles conflict with human nature, it is human nature that is required to give way. Rather than building a society that engenders happy human beings, the Controllers seek to design human beings that can function in the society into which they are \u201chatched\u201d.<br /><br />\n The idea that we would invert our relationship with the world in this way strikes us as sinister, as antithetical to what it means to be human. <br /><br />\n And yet something resembling this upside-down mindset is now emerging across the globe, particularly in the debate around climate change.</p><p>Having built a system that is destructive of the environment that surrounds and sustains us, we are now proposing to change \u2026 the environment! In his dystopia Huxley imagined a society that only worked when the humans within it were made into something not quite human. Today, many scientists and engineers imagine a planet that has been similarly transformed: nature itself must yield to the system. We need a technological <em>fix</em>.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/19/techno-capitalists-think-innovation-can-save-the-planet-but-that-same-thinking-is-what-got-us-here\">Continue reading...</a>",

Having a romantic dinner in Paris, getting on the night train and having coffee and croissants for breakfast in Nice on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur for example. I corrected the teenage mistake of trying to do too much and see too many places so we lingered longer in places such as Poland and Romania, soaking up the atmosphere in Wroc\u0142aw and Bucharest. It was interesting to compare the speed, quality and comfort of train services too.

You\u2019ll fall and break something.\u201d My brother, Andrew, 86, decided it was better not to tell anyone.</p><p>For at least two decades I\u2019d had a half-buried wish to experience one more ski trip. A final fix of blue sky, frosty air and the exhilaration that comes with finding yourself still intact at the bottom of a snow-covered slope. I was never much good, and hadn\u2019t skied for decades, but that wasn\u2019t the point. At 83, I needed to see if I could still do it. And if I could do it, how about inviting my sister, Kate, one-third of our Old Crones group who encourage each other to do parkrun each week? Then I remembered that, as teenagers, Andrew had joined me on my first ski holiday. That was 67 years ago, but Andrew used to be quite good, so I invited him too. My friend Penny, who is so absurdly young (67, so she says) that she doesn\u2019t really count, was also allowed to come and try her luck with the oldies and practise her German. We all made an effort to get as fit as possible, but none of us had skied for at least 40 years.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/oct/18/skiing-holiday-austria-hilary-bradt-83\">Continue reading...</a>",

In its first year of operation, Neko says that 1% of its patients received potentially life-saving intel, which is not nothing.

      "summary": "<p><strong>York Theatre Royal<br /></strong>Jeyasingh\u2019s choreography is well wrought and precise but Caliban\u2019s struggles with servitude and resistance feel adrift amid a sea of ideas</p><p>Choreographer Shobana Jeyasingh originally moved to the UK in the early 1980s to study Shakespeare, so it\u2019s safe to say she has deeply engaged with the playwright. It\u2019s a shame then that her latest work, We Caliban, inspired by The Tempest, doesn\u2019t manage to convey her rich ideas around this key character. We begin with a letter from Elizabeth I to Walter Raleigh from 1584, giving him licence to set out and conquer foreign lands, then maps of Caribbean islands, their original names crossed out and replaced with Anguilla, Grenada, Barbuda. Jeyasingh\u2019s postcolonial take on the text seems clear, Prospero the invader forcing native Caliban into servitude. But having established this on stage, the idea dissipates into something much more impressionistic, the conceptual thrust is lost. We\u2019re led into a story and then left stranded, like a Milanese duke and his daughter on a remote island.</p><p>Jeyasingh\u2019s dancing is always well wrought. Her background is in the Indian classical form bharatanatyam, melded with western contemporary dance, and she has a classicist\u2019s feel for proportion and precision, an acute (no pun intended) sense of angle and line. Character is less of a concern \u2013 the dancers aren\u2019t \u201cacting\u201d, as such \u2013 and the effect is flat. Prospero, with his book and his staff, controls in fairly benign fashion. Caliban gets more interesting. Dancer Ra\u00fal Reinoso Acanda (formerly of Cuba\u2019s Acosta Danza) has two key duets: first with Miranda, where there is resistance, or resentment, perhaps, but also a connection between them that leads to tenderness. Then after the colonists have left, a second enigmatic duet (with an unnamed woman, one of the island\u2019s original inhabitants). This one is cool and careful, the two are fascinated, yet wary and distant \u2013 their fingers only just touching in a long stretched pose. They look at the audience rather than each other, but they seem to have a kind of mutual understanding. What\u2019s going on here? The fallout, perhaps of trying to rebuild yourself when you\u2019ve been stripped of what was essentially you? Caliban now trying to work out how to be himself, how to live, how to trust?</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/oct/19/shobana-jeyasingh-dance-we-caliban-review-york-theatre-royal\">Continue reading...</a>",

Five funerals is too many. The first was my nan: she was the family matriarch. The oldest person in the family, so there was a&nbsp;level of acceptance among the sadness. But soon after it was her son, and then her granddaughter (my cousin). The latter two were shocks, completely upending my nervous system, one compounding the other. From there, two more followed. Death&nbsp;was all around. It wasn\u2019t just a&nbsp;part of life by that point \u2013 it was something to expect soon and often.</p><p>At first I seemed fine. Despite concerned friends and partners asking&nbsp;if I was hiding anything, I didn\u2019t think I&nbsp;was. But soon I retreated from fun, becoming very fixated on things like my resting heart rate and body fat percentage. I skipped social events for&nbsp;high-intensity interval training sessions followed by the sauna followed by meditation \u2013 not a&nbsp;bad thing, but not a balance, either. I&nbsp;cut out caffeine, including dark chocolate. When I didn\u2019t stick to my new routine, I would have a panic attack, which I\u2019d assume was a heart attack, which would lead to more frequent episodes of panic.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/oct/18/my-cultural-awakening-the-specials-helped-me-to-stop-fixating-on-death\">Continue reading...</a>",
