Having a romantic dinner in Paris, getting on the night train and having coffee and croissants for breakfast in Nice on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur for example. I corrected the teenage mistake of trying to do too much and see too many places so we lingered longer in places such as Poland and Romania, soaking up the atmosphere in Wroc\u0142aw and Bucharest. It was interesting to compare the speed, quality and comfort of train services too. We found that sometimes slow travel was better \u2013 like when we got on the wrong train from Rome to Naples, allowing us to appreciate the scenery, locals and way of life of people who were not in a hurry.

Should I be worried?</p><p><strong>Diagnosis</strong><br />\n Those circular brown patches are a classic sign of corking. This is a natural process in many cacti, which causes the lower stem to gradually harden and turn brown, like the bark on a tree. It usually starts at the base and slowly works its way up as the plant matures. While the rough texture can look alarming, it&nbsp;doesn\u2019t harm the plant. However, because corking can be confused with a fungal infection or pests such as scale insects, it\u2019s worth a closer look. Scale insects will appear as raised, uniform bumps that can be scraped off, whereas corking is part of the stem tissue itself and cannot be removed.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/oct/21/houseplant-clinic-what-are-the-brown-patches-on-my-prickly-pear\">Continue reading...</a>",

      "summary": "<p>Elmet, a novel that was shortlisted for the Booker, is a lyrical, richly written tale of a woodland family on a collision course with an avaricious landowner. Can it work on stage in Bradford?</p><p>Novelist Fiona Mozley and theatre-maker Javaad Alipoor are not an obvious match. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/09/elmet-fiona-mozley-review\">Elmet</a>, Mozley\u2019s Booker prize-shortlisted 2017 novel, is a lyrical and violent tale of land, family and revenge in semi-rural Yorkshire. Alipoor is best known for complex multimedia performances exploring digital technology, internet culture and geopolitics. But the contrast is what energises them about working on a stage adaptation for Bradford\u2019s year as City of Culture. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see how it was going to come together,\u201d says Mozley. \u201cBut that excited me.\u201d</p><p>Alipoor read Elmet during the pandemic and was struck by its \u201cgut-punch story\u201d. As fans of his company\u2019s work might expect, this is not what he calls a \u201croute one\u201d adaptation. Instead of focusing on plot and dialogue, he is maintaining the novel\u2019s evocative narrative mode and underlining the show\u2019s theatricality, with actors stepping in and out of character. Everything is refracted through the perspective of teenage Danny, who lives in the woods with his quietly seething sister Cathy and the hulking, almost superhuman Daddy, whose sense of right and hunger for violence sets them on a collision course with the avaricious local landowner.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/oct/21/elmet-booker-violence-greed-yorkshire-heath-fiona-mozley\">Continue reading...</a>",

This thrilling show, boasting 270 works, reveals the German in all his contradictory brilliance</p><p>Gerhard Richter recalls, as a child, drawing with his finger on his empty, slightly greasy dinner plate, tracing and retracing fanciful curves and spatial structures in endless alterations on the china. Decades later, he would place blobs of different colours on a canvas then intermingle them using slithery curving brushstrokes, lubricated by the oil and paint, until the entire surface was covered. More or less pure colour slid among the passages of impure, much-mixed pigment. Other paintings were made using large squeegees and spatulas, pushing and dragging paint over the surface, and just as often scraping it off again. The squeegee would often pick up previously applied, sometimes half-dried paint, excavating previous layers even as it applied new ones. Smearing paint on, dragging it off again, Richter would keep working until he could no longer think of anything else to do to a painting. One day in 2017, he stopped painting entirely. Since then, he has devoted himself mostly to drawing.</p><p>Richter\u2019s art is filled with beginnings and endings, revelling in chance as often as he has used craftsmanship and exactitude to paint people and places and things, from flowers wilting in a vase to street corners, elegiac landscapes and the dead. Standing amid his retrospective at the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris, it strikes me that however one chooses to describe or compartmentalise the different strands of his work, his art remains irreducible. It\u2019s contrarian, fickle, controlled yet intemperate, the contradictions make a mockery of fixed readings. His art is filled with fugues, with self-absorption and an objective stare.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/oct/21/electrifying-genius-gerhard-richter-review-louis-vuitton\">Continue reading...</a>",

Long shadows stretch behind illuminated objects, making the outlines of spectacularly supersized plants and tiny critters all the more pronounced. The casting of light is how you interact with the world: it often causes vegetation to grow before your eyes, and sometimes unusual inhabitants will feast upon it.
